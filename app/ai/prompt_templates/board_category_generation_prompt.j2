Generate 5 diverse, interesting categories for a Big Head game.
These should be challenging but accessible categories that could appear on the show.
Make them diverse in topics (e.g., don't have multiple categories about the same subject).

User preferences to consider: {{ user_input }}
Take these preferences into account when generating categories.

Return the result as a JSON object with a "categories" attribute containing an array of strings, like this:
{
    "categories": ["Category 1", "Category 2", "Category 3", "Category 4", "Category 5"]
}
